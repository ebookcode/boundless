# Introduction #

A Compound is the collective name for a function of the application. Compounds consist of a [Controller](http://code.google.com/p/boundless/wiki/Controller), [Model](http://code.google.com/p/boundless/wiki/Model), and [View](http://code.google.com/p/boundless/wiki/View).


# Details #

Compounds are the workhorses of a Boundless application. They are essentially a group of functions that access a common database table for different purposes, and the associated template files to display the output of each function.
