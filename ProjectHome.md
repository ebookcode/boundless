# The Lowdown #
Boundless is a Model-View-Controller (MVC) style PHP rapid development framework. It follows in the footsteps of other existing frameworks, but with your Average Joe developer in mind.

# Zero Bloat #
There is no sprawling documentation; there really isn't that much to document. Everything provided in Boundless is just the bare essentials of a PHP framework, zero bloat. It's designed to get you off your feet, and out of your way -- but is always there to help.

# Limitations #
Boundless is not designed to handle massive applications, but small-medium sized personal projects that don't need the immense frameworks that are out there. It should not be used to learn PHP, however; knowledge of OOP is required to truly understand Boundless, although you could get by developing on Boundless with very rudimentary PHP knowledge. Boundless does not support SQL, and will not support it in the future unless there is significant demand.

# Features #
  * A MVC style architecture for organization and efficiency
  * A speedy flat-file database system ([Fetch](http://code.google.com/p/boundless/wiki/Fetch)) for self-contained data storage
  * A database management system (FarFetch) on top of Fetch, to ease certain tasks like data validation.
  * Scaffolding for the basic Create-Read-Update-Delete (CRUD) operations, so you can get off the ground never having to touch the database -- just define your Model and you have a working website.
  * HTML helpers that automate tasks like creating quality input forms.
  * "Pretty URLs" come standard -- e.g. "site.com/posts/new-dog" vs "site.com/index.php?post=4"
  * User profile, rank and session management

# The Future #
Boundless is an evolving framework, and features are likely to come and go in subsequent releases.
